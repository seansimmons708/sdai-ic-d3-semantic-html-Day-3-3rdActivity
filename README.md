## ToDo list ✅
**Attention**: When you complete a task, put an `x` in the middle of the brackets to mark it off your ToDo list.

1. [x] Navigate to the `index.html` file. 
2. [x] Then navigate to the closing `</main>` tag. 
3. [x] Below that, create a third `<section>`, put a subheader element with the copy: `Contact`.
4. [x] Under that, put a paragraph element with the copy: `If you'd like to reach out, feel free to visit our office:`
5. [x] Now put an `<address>` tag (yes there is one) under that with three paragraph tags:
   1. [x] The first paragraph tag should be **bold** using the correct semantic element with the copy: `My Awesome Web Development Co.`.
   2. [x] The second paragraph is normal with the copy: `4464 Hickory Ridge Drive`.
   3. [x] The third paragraph is normal with the copy: `Las Vegas, NV 55555`.
6. [x] And finally, below the section you just made, create a `<footer>` element with the copy: `&copy; Chris Doe 2024`.
